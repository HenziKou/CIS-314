A) The total of memory reads is, 4 x 16 x 16 because it writes to memory 4 times for 16 times
   it goes through the inner loop and another 16 times for the outer loop, thus the total
   number of memory reads is 1024.

B) The total of memory reads that miss in the cache is, (1/8) * 1024 because for every
   7 hits we get 1 miss (7:1), so can multiply that with the total number of memory reads.
   Thus the total number of memory reads that is missed is 128.

C) Given that we know the total number of writes and the number of missed ones as well. Then
   the miss rate is given by: (number of misses) / (number of total writes). Therefore we
   have the miss rate as (128/1024) * 100 = %12.5.
